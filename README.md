This project runs on codeblocks.

After starting the game, we are asked to choose one of the scenarios from 1 to 10. 
After entering the number of the scenario we want to choose, the game starts with enter. 
After starting the game, the battle starts with the (space) key and the end game status is shown on the screen. 
Battle steps are saved in a file named savas_sim.txt.
